About Airquality Data ShinyApp
==================================
This Shiny app helps us to explore the **airquality** dataset in R. The dataset contains the daily air quality measurements in New York between May to September 1973.

In this app, we will focus on 4 variables (or factors) only:
- Ozone
- Solar radiation (Solar R) 
- Wind 
- Temperature 

In order to show the distribution of these 4 factors, you may plot the **histogram** of the selected factor.

You may also visualise the data by using **scatterplots** to explore the Ozone reading with the other 3 factors. The **regression line** further helps us to understand the relationship between the dependent variables and the Ozone variable.
